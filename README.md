3. **Engagement by Student Type**: How do students engage with the platform (total minutes and average minutes watched) based on their type (free-plan or paying)?
4. **Engagement Over Time**: Do students watch more content with time, and does it vary seasonally?
5. **Geographic Trends**: Which countries have the most students registered, and does this number scale proportionally with the number of minutes watched per country?
